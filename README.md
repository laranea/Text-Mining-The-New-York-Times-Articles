# Text-Mining-The-New-York-Times-Articles

## Introducton 

This project covers step-by-step how to mine text from The New York Times' online articles by using Python given a dictionary of words, time range and country of interest. At the same time, it enumerates the key steps to follow in any text mining project, and gives an overview of a specific dictionary text mining technique. The intuition behind this technique is that the frequency of words and their occurrence are good indicators of the topic or sentiment expressed in texts.

The code is structured as appears in the figure below.
