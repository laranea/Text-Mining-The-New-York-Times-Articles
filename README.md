# Text-Mining-The-New-York-Times-Articles

This project covers step-by-step how to **mine text from The New York Times' online articles by using Python given a dictionary of words, time range and country of interest**. At the same time, it enumerates the key steps to follow in any text mining project, and gives an overview of a specific dictionary text mining technique. The intuition behind this technique is that the frequency of words and their occurrence are good indicators of the topic or sentiment expressed in texts.

## Introduction 

The code is structured in six stages as shown in the figure below. The approach to each stage is briefly explained along this Readme file.
